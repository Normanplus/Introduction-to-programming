<h1>What i learnt from Stage 0</h1>

<em>HTML is a markup language</em>
<p>HTML needs tags to tell the computer how we want it do, making the text bold or italicize or citing an image.</p>

<em>Try to use the external source</em>
<p>At first, i worried about remembering all the tags and attributes.<br>This course made the worry flourished. I can use the Google, coding books and documents to search for the proper tags or attributes.</p>

<em>Try to learn Markdown with HTML</em>
<p>I have known the Markdown language for a long time. But i don't understand the meaning of it. After learning the bascis of HTML, i realized that Markdown is also a markup language. What i need to do is figure out which tags the Markdown uses.</p>
<p>Yesterday i read a webpage about <a href="markdown.tw">Markdown rules</a>. I can almost understand all the words in the webpage. I feel good for this change.</p>

<em>Try to view the source code of webpages</em>
<p>Now i like to view the source code of webpages. I try to find out which codes make the functions on the webpage real.</p>
